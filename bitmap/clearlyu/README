Version: 1.8
6 December 2000

This set of fonts provides a 12pt, 100dpi proportional font with many of
the glyphs needed for Unicode text.  I call the typeface "ClearlyU" and
it was influenced by Donald Knuth's Computer Modern.

The fonts together contain 7564 glyphs at the moment.

Information about this font and samples, are located at:

  http://crl.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/cu.html

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
================
Thanks to Otto Stolz <Otto.Stolz@uni-konstanz.de> for finding spelling errors
in one of the Greek samples.
